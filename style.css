Theme name: Modern Suffrages
Author: Ines Piatkowska, Ólafur Árdal Sigurdsson, Tamás Major
Version: 0.1
Description: Our Wordpress theme and website for SDG project week. We decided to go with the topic of movements for women's equalities and right to abortion in the recent years, as it's a current and very serious topic that requires more attention. Putting our ideas together and implementing them in a website could hopefully open up some eyes to see what's happening. We went with the title "Modern Suffrages".
